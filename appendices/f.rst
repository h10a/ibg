|L|\ibrary files define Inform's model world, turning a conventional
programming language into a text adventure development system.  Here are
the library constants, variables and routines, the standard object
properties and attributes, the verb grammars and actions.

Library objects
===============

:obj:`compass`
  A :attr:`container` object holding the twelve direction objects
  :obj:`d_obj`, :obj:`e_obj`, :obj:`in_obj`, :obj:`n_obj`, :obj:`ne_obj`,
  :obj:`nw_obj`, :obj:`out_obj`, :obj:`s_obj`, :obj:`se_obj`,
  :obj:`sw_obj`, :obj:`u_obj`, :obj:`w_obj`.

:obj:`LibraryMessages`
  If defined (between Includes of `Parser` and `VerbLib`), changes standard
  library messages:

  | `Object LibraryMessages`
  |   `with before [;`
  |        `{action}: "{string}";`
  |        `{action}: "{string}";`
  |        `{action}: switch (lm_n) {`
  |                `{value}: "{string}";`
  |                `{value}: "{string}",`
  |                    `(a) lm_o,".";`
  |                `...`
  |                `}`
  |            `...`
  |        `];`

:obj:`selfobj`
  The default player object.  Avoid: use instead the :var:`player`
  variable, which usually refers to :obj:`selfobj`.

:obj:`thedark`
  A pseudo-room which becomes the :var:`location` when there is no light
  (although the player object is not moved there).

Library constants
=================

In addition to the standard constants :const:`true` (1), :const:`false` (0)
and :const:`nothing` (0), the Library defines :const:`NULL` (-1) for an
`{action}`, `{property}` or `{pronoun}` whose current value is undefined.

`LIBRARY_PARSER`, `LIBRARY_ENGLISH`, `LIBRARY_VERBLIB` and
`LIBRARY_GRAMMAR` are defined to mark the end of inclusion of `Parser.h`,
`English.h`, `VerbLib.h` and `Grammar.h` respectively.

User-defined constants
======================

Some constants control features rather than represent values.

`AMUSING_PROVIDED`
  Activates the `Amusing` entry point.

`COMMENT_CHARACTER = '{char}'`
  Introduces a comment line ignored by the parser (default "*").

`DEATH_MENTION_UNDO`
  Offers "UNDO the last move" at game end.

`DEBUG`
  Activates the debug commands.

`Headline = "{string}"`
  **Mandatory**: game style, copyright info, etc.

`MANUAL_PRONOUNS`
  Pronouns reflect only objects mentioned by the player.

`MAX_CARRIED = {expr}`
  Limit on direct possessions that the player can carry (default 100).

`MAX_SCORE = {expr}`
  Maximum game score (default 0).

`MAX_TIMERS = {expr}`
  Limit on active timers/daemons (default 32).

`NO_PLACES`
  "`OBJECTS`" and "`PLACES`" verbs are barred.

`NO_SCORE`
  Game doesn't use scoring.

`NUMBER_TASKS = {expr}`
  Number of `scored` tasks (default 1).

`OBJECT_SCORE = {expr}`
  For taking a `scored` object for the first time (default 4).

`ROOM_SCORE = {expr}`
  For visiting a `scored` room for the first time (default 5).

`SACK_OBJECT = {obj_id}`
  A `container` object where the game places held objects.

`START_MOVE = {expr}`

  **Mandatory**: the name of the story.

`TASKS_PROVIDED`
  Activates the task scoring system.

`USE_MODULES`
  Activates linking with pre-compiled library modules.

`WITHOUT_DIRECTIONS`
  De-activates standard compass directions (bar "`IN`" and "`OUT`").  Place
  alternative directions in the :obj:`compass`.

.. _object-props:

Object properties
=================

Where the `value` of a property can be a routine, several formats are
possible (but remember: embedded "`]`" returns :const:`false`, standalone
"`]`" returns :const:`true`):

  | `{property} [; {stmt}; {stmt}; ... ]`
  | `{property} [; return {routine_id}(); ]`
  | `{property} [; {routine_id}(); ]`
  | `{property} {routine_id}`

In this appendix, |ADD| marks an additive property.  Where a `Class` and an
`Object` of that class both define the same property, the value specified
for the `Object` normally overrides the value inherited from the `Class`.
However, if the property is additive then both values apply, with the
Object's value being considered first.

.. index::
   pair: add_to_scope; library property

:prop:`add_to_scope`
  For an object: additional objects which follow it in and out of scope.
  The `{value}` can be a space-separated list of `{obj_ids}`, or a routine
  which invokes `PlaceInScope()` or `ScopeWithin()` to specify objects.

.. index::
   pair: after; library property

:prop:`after` |ADD|
  For an object: receives every `{action}` and `{fake_action}` for which
  this is the `{noun}`.  For a room: receives every `{action}` which occurs
  here.

  The `{value}` is a routine of structure similar to a `switch` statement,
  having cases for the appropriate `{actions}` (and an optional `default`
  as well); it is invoked after the action has happened, but before the
  player has been informed.  The routine should return :const:`false` to
  continue, telling the player what has happened, or :const:`true` to stop
  processing the action and produce no further output.

.. index::
   pair: article; library property

:prop:`article`
  For an object: the object's indefinite article - the default is
  automatically "a", "an" or "some".  The `{value}` can be a string, or a
  routine which outputs a string.

.. index::
   pair: articles; library property

:prop:`articles`
  For a non-English object: its definite and indefinite articles.  The
  `{value}` is an array of strings.

.. index::

  initial capacity of `MAX_CARRIED`.

  The `{value}` can be a number, or a routine which returns a number.

.. index::
   pair: d_to; library property

:prop:`d_to`
  For a room: a possible exit.  The `{value}` can be

  * :const:`false` (the default): not an exit;
  * a string: output to explain why this is not an exit;
  * a `{room}`: the exit leads to this room;
  * a :obj:`door` object: the exit leads through this door;
  * a routine which should return :const:`false`, a string, a `{room}`, a
    :obj:`door` object, or :const:`true` to signify "not an exit" and
    produce no further output.

.. index::
   pair: daemon; library property

:prop:`daemon`
  The `{value}` is a routine which can be activated by
  `StartDaemon({obj_id})` and which then runs once each turn until
  deactivated by `StopDaemon({obj_id})`.

.. index::
   pair: describe; library property

:prop:`describe` |ADD|
  For an object: called before the object's description is output.  For a
  room: called before the room's (long) description is output.

  outputting the usual description, or :const:`true` to stop processing and
  produce no further output.

.. index::
   pair: description; library property

:prop:`description`
  For an object: its description (output by `Examine`).

  For a room: its long description (output by `Look`).

  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.

   pair: door_dir; library property

:prop:`door_dir`
  For a :obj:`compass` object (:obj:`d_obj`, :obj:`e_obj`, ...): the
  direction in which an attempt to move to this object actually leads.

  * :const:`false` (the default): leads nowhere;
  * a string: output to explain why door leads nowhere;
  * a `{room}`: the door leads to this room;
  * a routine which should return :const:`false`, a string, a `{room}`, or
    :const:`true` to signify "leads nowhere" without producing any output.

     in the current location, otherwise :const:`false`.

.. index::
   pair: grammar; library property

:prop:`grammar`
  For an :attr:`animate` or :attr:`talkable` object: the `{value}` is a
  routine called when the parser knows that this object is being addressed,
  but has yet to test the grammar.  The routine should return
  :const:`false` to continue, :const::const:`true` to indicate that the
  routine has parsed the entire command, or a dictionary word ('`word`' or

  description when the player is inside the object.

  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.

.. index::
   pair: invent; library property

:prop:`invent`
  For an object: the `{value}` is a routine for outputting the object's
  inventory listing, which is called twice.  On the first call nothing has
  been output; :var:`inventory_stage` has the value 1, and the routine
  should return :const:`false` to continue, or :const:`true` to stop
  processing and produce no further output.  On the second call the
  object's indefinite article and short name have been output, but not any
  subsidiary information; :var:`inventory_stage` has the value 2, and the
  routine should return :const:`false` to continue, or :const:`true` to
  stop processing and produce no further output.

.. index::
   pair: life; library property

:prop:`life` |ADD|
  For an `animate` object: receives person-to-person actions (`Answer`,
  `Ask`, `Attack`, `Give`, `Kiss`, `Order`, `Show`, `Tell`, `ThrowAt` and
  `WakeOther`) for which this is the `{noun}`.  The `{value}` is a routine
  of structure similar to a `switch` statement, having cases for the
  appropriate `{actions}` (and an optional default as well).  The routine
  should return :const:`false` to continue, telling the player what has

    output; :var:`inventory_stage` has the value 1, and the routine should
    return :const:`false` to continue, or :const::const:`true` to stop
    processing and produce no further output.  On the second call the list
    has been output; :var:`inventory_stage` has the value 2, and there is

Optional entry points
=====================

These routines, if you supply them, are called when shown.

`AfterLife()`
  Player has died; `deadflag=0` resurrects.

`AfterPrompt()`
  The ">" prompt has been output.

`Amusing()`
  Player has won; `AMUSING_PROVIDED` is defined.

`BeforeParsing()`
  The parser has input some text, set up the buffer and parse tables, and
  initialised :var:`wn` to 1.

`ChooseObjects({object,flag})`
  Parser has found "`ALL`" or an ambiguous noun phrase and decided that
  `{object}` should be excluded (`flag` is 0), or included (`flag` is 1).
  The routine should return 0 to let this stand, 1 to force inclusion, or 2
  to force exclusion.  If `flag` is 2, parser is undecided; routine should
  return appropriate score 0..9.

`DarkToDark()`
  The player has gone from one dark room to another.

`DeathMessage()`
  The player has died; `deadflag` is 3 or more.

`GamePostRoutine()`
  Called after all actions.

`GamePreRoutine()`
  Called before all actions.

`Initialise()`
  **Mandatory; note British spelling**: called at start.  Must set
  `location`; can return 2 to suppress game banner.

`InScope()`
  Called during parsing.

`LookRoutine()`
  Called at the end of every `Look` description.

`NewRoom()`
  Called when room changes, before description is output.
