ibrary files define Inform's model world, turning a conventional
programming language into a text adventure development system.  Here are
the library constants, variables and routines, the standard object
properties and attributes, the verb grammars and actions.

Library objects
===============

`compass`
  A `container` object holding the twelve direction objects `d_obj e_obj
  in_obj n_obj ne_obj nw_obj out_obj s_obj se_obj sw_obj u_obj w_obj`.

`LibraryMessages`
  If defined (between Includes of `Parser` and `VerbLib`), changes standard
  library messages:

  .. only:: html

    | `Object LibraryMessages`
    |   `with before [;`
    |        `{action}: "{string}";`
    |        `{action}: "{string}";`
    |        `{action}: switch (lm_n) {`
    |                `{value}: "{string}";`
    |                `{value}: "{string}",`
    |                    `(a) lm_o,".";`
    |                `...`
    |                `}`
    |            `...`
    |        `];`

  .. todo::

     Get this to work properly in LaTeX.  Currently get a 'too deeply
     nested' error.

`selfobj`
  The default player object.  Avoid: use instead the `player` variable,
  which usually refers to `selfobj`.

`thedark`
  A pseudo-room which becomes the `location` when there is no light
  (although the player object is not moved there).

Library constants
=================

In addition to the standard constants `true` (1), `false` (0) and `nothing`
(0), the Library defines `NULL` (-1) for an `{action}`, `{property}` or
`{pronoun}` whose current value is undefined.

`LIBRARY_PARSER`, `LIBRARY_ENGLISH`, `LIBRARY_VERBLIB` and
`LIBRARY_GRAMMAR` are defined to mark the end of inclusion of `Parser.h`,
`English.h`, `VerbLib.h` and `Grammar.h` respectively.

User-defined constants
======================

Some constants control features rather than represent values.

`AMUSING_PROVIDED`

  objects with own paragraphs, the rest are listed preceded by `{string1}`
  or `{string2}`.

`LoopOverScope({routine_id,actor})`
  Calls `{routine_id}({obj_id})` for each `{obj_id}` in scope.  If the
  optional `{actor}` is supplied, that defines the scope.

`MoveFloatingObjects()`
  Adjusts positions of game's `found_in` objects.

`NextWord()`

  by one.  Returns `false` if the word is not in the dictionary, or if the
  input stream is exhausted.

`NextWordStopped()`
  Returns the next dictionary word in the input stream, incrementing `wn`
  by one.  Returns `false` if the word is not in the dictionary, -1 if the
  input stream is exhausted.

`NounDomain({obj_id1,obj_id2,type})`
  Performs object parsing; see also `ParseToken()`.

`ObjectIsUntouchable({obj_id,flag})`
  Tests whether there is a barrier - a container object which is not open -
  between player and `{obj_id}`.  Unless the optional `{flag}` is `true`,
  outputs "You can't because ... is in the way".  Returns `true` is a

  routine, run it and return what the routine returns.

`PronounNotice({obj_id})`
  Associates an appropriate pronoun with the `{obj_id}`.

`PronounValue('{pronoun}')`
  Returns the object to which '`it`' (or '`him`', '`her`', '`them`')
  currently refers, or `nothing`.

`ScopeWithin({obj_id})`
  Used in an `add_to_scope` property or `scope=` token to put the contents
  of the `{obj_id}` in scope for the parser.

`SetPronoun('{pronoun}',{obj_id})`

  | zero: time stands still.

`StartDaemon({obj_id})`
  Starts the `{obj_id}`\'s daemon.

`StartTimer({obj_id,expr})`

  optional `{actor}` is supplied, that defines the scope.

`TryNumber({expr})`
  Parses word `{expr}` in the input stream as a number, recognising
  decimals, also English words one..twenty.  Returns the number 1..10000,
  or -1000 if the parse fails.

`UnsignedCompare({expr1,expr2})`
  Returns -1 if `{expr1}` is less than `{expr2}`, 0 if `{expr1}` equals
  `{expr2}`, and 1 if `{expr1}` is greater than `{expr2}`.  Both

`ZRegion({arg})`
  Returns the type of its `{arg}` : 3 for a string address, 2 for a routine
  address, 1 for an object number, or 0 otherwise.

Object properties
=================

Where the `value` of a property can be a routine, several formats are
possible (but remember: embedded "`]`" returns `false`, standalone "`]`"
returns `true`):

  | `{property} [; {stmt}; {stmt}; ... ]`
  | `{property} [; return {routine_id}(); ]`
  | `{property} [; {routine_id}(); ]`
  | `{property} {routine_id}`

In this appendix, |ADD| marks an additive property.  Where a `Class` and an
`Object` of that class both define the same property, the value specified
for the `Object` normally overrides the value inherited from the `Class`.
However, if the property is additive then both values apply, with the
Object's value being considered first.

`add_to_scope`
  For an object: additional objects which follow it in and out of scope.
  The `{value}` can be a space-separated list of `{obj_ids}`, or a routine
  which invokes `PlaceInScope()` or `ScopeWithin()` to specify objects.

`after` |ADD|
  For an object: receives every `{action}` and `{fake_action}` for which
  this is the `{noun}`.  For a room: receives every `{action}` which occurs
  here.

  The `{value}` is a routine of structure similar to a `switch` statement,
  having cases for the appropriate `{actions}` (and an optional `default`
  as well); it is invoked after the action has happened, but before the
  player has been informed.  The routine should return `false` to continue,
  telling the player what has happened, or `true` to stop processing the
  action and produce no further output.

`article`
  For an object: the object's indefinite article - the default is
  automatically "a", "an" or "some".  The `{value}` can be a string, or a
  routine which outputs a string.

`articles`
  For a non-English object: its definite and indefinite articles.  The
  `{value}` is an array of strings.

`before` |ADD|
  For an object: receives every `{action}` and `{fake_action}` for which
  this is the `{noun}`.  For a room: receives every action which occurs
  here.

  The `{value}` is a routine invoked before the action has happened.  See
  `after`.

`cant_go`
  For a room: the message when the player attempts an impossible exit.  The
  `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.

`capacity`
  For a `container` or `supporter` object: the number of objects which can
  be placed in or on it - the default is 100.

  For the player: the number which can be carried - `selfobj` has an
  initial capacity of `MAX_CARRIED`.

  The `{value}` can be a number, or a routine which returns a number.

`d_to`
  For a room: a possible exit.  The `{value}` can be

  * `false` (the default): not an exit;
  * a string: output to explain why this is not an exit;
  * a `{room}`: the exit leads to this room;
  * a `door` object: the exit leads through this door;
  * a routine which should return `false`, a string, a `{room}`, a `door`
    object, or `true` to signify "not an exit" and produce no further
    output.

`daemon`
  The `{value}` is a routine which can be activated by
  `StartDaemon({obj_id})` and which then runs once each turn until
  deactivated by `StopDaemon({obj_id})`.

`describe` |ADD|
  For an object: called before the object's description is output.  For a
  room: called before the room's (long) description is output.

  The `{value}` is a routine which should return `false` to continue,
  outputting the usual description, or `true` to stop processing and
  produce no further output.

`description`
  For an object: its description (output by `Examine`).

  For a room: its long description (output by `Look`).

  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.

`door_dir`
  For a `compass` object (`d_obj`, `e_obj`, ...): the direction in which an
  attempt to move to this object actually leads.

  For a `door` object: the direction in which this door leads.

  The `{value}` can be a directional property (`d_to`, `e_to`, ...), or a
  routine which returns such a property.

`door_to`
  For a `door` object: where it leads.  The value can be

  * `false` (the default): leads nowhere;
  * a string: output to explain why door leads nowhere;
  * a `{room}`: the door leads to this room;
  * a routine which should return `false`, a string, a `{room}`, or `true`
    to signify "leads nowhere" without producing any output.

`e_to`
  See `d_to`.

`each_turn` |ADD|
  Invoked at the end of each turn (after all appropriate daemons and
  timers) whenever the object is in scope.  The `{value}` can be a string,
  or a routine.

`found_in`
  For an object: the rooms where this object can be found, unless it has
  the `absent` attribute.  The `{value}` can be

  * a space-separated list of `{rooms}` (where this object can be found) or
     `{obj_ids}` (whose locations are tracked by this object);
  * a routine which should return `true` if this object can be found in the
     current location, otherwise `false`.

`grammar`
  For an `animate` or `talkable` object: the `{value}` is a routine called
  when the parser knows that this object is being addressed, but has yet to
  test the grammar.  The routine should return `false` to continue, `true`
  to indicate that the routine has parsed the entire command, or a
  dictionary word ('`word`' or -'`word`').

`in_to`
  See `d_to`.

`initial`
  For an object: its description before being picked up.

  For a room: its description when the player enters the room.

  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.

`inside_description`
  For an `enterable` object: its description, output as part of the room
  description when the player is inside the object.

  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.

`invent`
  For an object: the `{value}` is a routine for outputting the object's
  inventory listing, which is called twice.  On the first call nothing has
  been output; `inventory_stage` has the value 1, and the routine should
  return `false` to continue, or `true` to stop processing and produce no
  further output.  On the second call the object's indefinite article and
  short name have been output, but not any subsidiary information;
  `inventory_stage` has the value 2, and the routine should return `false`
  to continue, or `true` to stop processing and produce no further output.

`life` |ADD|
  For an `animate` object: receives person-to-person actions (`Answer`,
  `Ask`, `Attack`, `Give`, `Kiss`, `Order`, `Show`, `Tell`, `ThrowAt` and
  `WakeOther`) for which this is the `{noun}`.  The `{value}` is a routine
  of structure similar to a `switch` statement, having cases for the
  appropriate `{actions}` (and an optional default as well).  The routine
  should return `false` to continue, telling the player what has happened,
  or `true` to stop processing the action and produce no further output.

`list_together`

  For an object: groups related objects when outputting an inventory or
  room contents list.  The `{value}` can be

  * a `{number}`: all objects having this value are grouped;
  * a `{string}`: all objects having this value are grouped as a count of
    the string;
  * a routine which is called twice.  On the first call nothing has been
    output; `inventory_stage` has the value 1, and the routine should
    return `false` to continue, or `true` to stop processing and produce no
    further output.  On the second call the list has been output;
    `inventory_stage` has the value 2, and there is no test on the return
    value.

`n_to`
  See `d_to`.

`name` |ADD|
  Defines a space-separated list of words which are added to the Inform
  dictionary.  Each word can be supplied in apostrophes '...'  or quotes
  "..."; in all other cases only words in apostrophes update the
  dictionary.

  For an object: identifies this object.

  For a room: outputs "does not need to be referred to".

`ne_to`
  See `d_to`.

`number`
  For an object or room: the `{value}` is a general-purpose variable freely
  available for use by the program.  A `player` object must provide (but
  not use) this variable.

`nw_to`
  See `d_to`.

`orders` |ADD|
  For an `animate` or `talkable` object: the `{value}` is a routine called
  to carry out the player's orders.  The routine should return `false` to
  continue, or `true` to stop processing the action and produce no further
  output.

`out_to`
  See `d_to`.

`parse_name`
  For an object: the `{value}` is a routine called to parse an object's
  name.  The routine should return zero if the text makes no sense, -1 to
  cause the parser to resume, or the positive number of words matched.

`plural`
  For an object: its plural form, when in the presence of others like it.
  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.

`react_after`
  For an object: detects nearby actions - those which take place when this
  object is in scope.  The `{value}` is a routine invoked after the action
  has happened, but before the player has been informed.  See `after`.

`react_before`
  For an object: detects nearby actions - those which take place when this
  object is in scope.  The `{value}` is a routine invoked before the action
  has happened.  See `after`.

`s_to`

`se_to`
  See `d_to`.

`short_name`
  For an object: an alternative or extended short name.  The `{value}` can
  be a string, or a routine which outputs a string.  The routine should
  return `false` to continue by outputting the object's *actual* short name
  (from the head of the object definition), or `true` to stop processing
  the action and produce no further output.

`short_name_indef`
  For a non-English object: the short name when preceded by an indefinite
  object.  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which outputs a
  string.

`sw_to`
  See `d_to`.

`time_left`
  For a timer object: the `{value}` is a variable to hold the number of
  turns left until this object's timer - activated and initialised by
  `StartTimer({obj_id})` - counts down to zero and invokes the object's
  `time_out` property.

`time_out`
  For a timer object: the `{value}` is a routine which is run when the
  object's `time_left` value - initialised by `StartTimer({obj_id})`, and
  not in the meantime cancelled by `StopTimer({obj_id})` - counts down to
  zero.

`u_to`

`w_to`
  See `d_to`.

`when_closed`

`when_open`
  For a `container` or `door` object: used when including this object in a
  room's long description.  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine
  which outputs a string.

`when_off`

`when_on`
  For a `switchable` object: used when including this object in a room's
  long description.  The `{value}` can be a string, or a routine which
  outputs a string.

`with_key`
  For a `lockable` object: the `{obj_id}` (generally some kind of key)
  needed to lock and unlock the object, or `nothing` if no key fits.

Optional entry points
=====================

These routines, if you supply them, are called when shown.

`AfterLife()`
  Player has died; `deadflag=0` resurrects.

`AfterPrompt()`
  The ">" prompt has been output.

`Amusing()`
